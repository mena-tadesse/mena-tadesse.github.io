        <h3><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a></h3>
        <p>
            Airbnb is a platform that empowers travelers to discover and book a wide range of accommodations, 
            from cozy homes to exotic getaways, while also offering unique local experiences hosted by residents
             in various destinations around the world.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast: </strong> Airbnb effectively employs contrast by featuring a light background and 
                a dark foreground, enhancing readability for text and images. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> The website keeps things pretty consistent across its pages. They have three 
                colors, and use the brightest one sparingly to make important information pop. When it comes to fonts, they 
                mix it up with two styles, changing the size depending on the content's significance. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong> Airbnb makes good use of the grid system, allowing the content to be visually 
                appealing and easy to understand. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong> The website aligns all related content together, creating a cohesive effect. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
        <p>
            Arngren is a unique website known for its eccentric collection of gadgets, inventions, and quirky products. It's a 
            platform that showcases Leif Arngren's inventive spirit and sense of humor. Its often featured humorous and bizarre 
            product descriptions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast: </strong> Arngren makes somewhat okay use of contrast in the website. It has a light background
                with a darker colored foreground for text. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> The website has very little repetition on the pages. The text color varies randomly, 
                but luckily the font is unified! 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong> Arngren has no alignment anywhere. Its so bad that content is placed on top of each other, making
                it impossible to read! 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong> I can't tell what content is related to each other, but at least there is a menu bar... 
            </li>
        </ul>
